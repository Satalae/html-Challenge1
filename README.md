# This is the ReadMe for the Module 1 HTML Challenge!

In this project, we have been assigned to work independently on a provided html and css file for a company named Horiseon,
a made up company with html and css pages that had a few problems.

# HTML

The HTML page originally had a non-function link for Search Engine Optimization. The expected functionality was that when
clicked, it would send you down to a section header of the same name.

>The solution was that it was referred to as div class="search-engine-optimization", but lacked the ID so that it could be 
  called inside the css file.

# CSS

The CSS page on the other hand functioned just fine, however it lacked proper semantic structure and comments. 

>The solution was to structure it properly, as the selectors for Sections were under the Aside's code, and to actually
  look through the functionality of the code and properly comment the functionality of each selector, along with dividing
  each each section(not the section selector, but body/header/h2/section/aside/footer, etc) into their proper groups.
